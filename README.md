✅ Tkinter To-Do List App (Python GUI)
A simple and functional To-Do List application built using Python’s tkinter library. This app allows users to add, delete, save, and load their tasks with a clean GUI interface. Data persistence is handled using Python’s pickle module.

🖼️ Features
📝 Add new tasks to a list.
❌ Delete selected tasks.
💾 Save tasks to a local file (tasks.dat).
📂 Load tasks from a saved file.
🧾 Scrollable task list.
📦 No external dependencies — uses only Python’s standard library.

📌 Application Overview
The application opens in a 500x500 window.
Tasks are displayed in a Listbox.
You can enter new tasks in the entry field.
Buttons available:
Add task
Delete task
Save tasks (writes to tasks.dat)

📂 File Storage
Tasks are stored in a file named tasks.dat using binary format via pickle.
Make sure the file is in the same directory when loading tasks.
